Thanks to Kaixu Zhang for contributing zseg segmentation program.
This program is quite fast.

Setup:

    Download zseg_data.tar.gz from the download section on github and
    extract the two bin files here.

    Compile zseg.cpp to zseg, test it with ./zseg. It reads from stdin
    and outputs to stdout.
